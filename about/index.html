    <h1 class="name">Hi, I'm Erik.</h1>

    <div class="article">
      <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in the suburbs of Milwaukee, I am now studying computer science and science in society at Wesleyan University.  For the fall semester of 2013, I will be studying abroad in Budapest Hungary at <a href="http://www.ait-budapest.com">AIT</a>.  Here, I am taking courses in computer science as well as entrepreneurship.</p>  

        <p>Though I find great satisfaction in creating software that makes everyday tasks simpler and more enjoyable, I also care greatly about how that software functions in a user's (read: non-developer's) hands.  From this, I have chosen my second major, science in society with a concentration in sociology.  Through this I am studying the impacts technology has and does have on societies around the world.</p>

      <h2>Technical Things for Geeks</h2>
      <h4><i>I love geeks – It means you have passion for something. When I grow up, I want to be a geek.</i></h4>
        <p>Before this website, I had almost no experience with HTML or CSS, and equally limited experience with javascript on static webpages.  As such this site is a rough start, though development thus far has been very smooth provided I have a large enough chunk of time to devote.  The code was written in vim by only myself (hence the externally hosted photo collection and blog) save for google analytics code.  As a implement these features myself, I will update the site to show more of my work.  All code to date is viewable on my <a href="https://github.com/jacthinman/lpage">github</a>.</p>

        <p>My main text editor is vim, though I started with emacs in COMP 211 at Wesleyan and have recently been playing with sublime text 2.  I mainly work in python and Standard ML/NJ for academic work, though I have experience with Javascript, Ruby, and a few others (see my resume).
