      <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in the suburbs of Milwaukee, I am now studying computer science and science in society (sociology concentration) at <a href="http://wesleyan.edu/">Wesleyan University</a> ('15).  During fall semester 2013 I am studying computer science and entrepreneurship in Budapest, Hungary at the <a href="http://www.ait-budapest.com">Aquincum Institute of Technology</a>.</p>  

        <p>Though I find great satisfaction in creating software that makes everyday tasks simpler and more enjoyable, I also care greatly about how that software functions in a user's (read: non-developer's) hands.  From this, two things follow: First, I am fixated on the design of the things I create – not just how it looks, but how it is used.  Second, and this is where the science in society major originates, I am also very intersted in how new technologies change the way people live and act – socially, intellectually, emotionally, etc.  The change in technology that we use on a daily basis has changed at a nearly unfathomable scale in the past few decades, and I am studying how that impacts us individually and from a broader societal perspective.</p>

      <h2>Technical Things for Geeks</h2>
      <h4><i>"When I grow up, I want to be a geek." -Me, at some point in childhood.</i></h4>
        <p>Before building this website I had almost no experience with HTML or CSS, and equally limited experience with javascript on static webpages.  As such, this site is a pretty rough start though development thus far has been reasonably smooth.  The code was written in vim soley by me (hence the externally hosted photo collection and blog, for now) save for some google analytics code.  As I implement more features myself, I will update the site to show more of my work.  All code to date is viewable on <a href="https://github.com/jacthinman/lpage">github</a>.</p>

        <p>My main text editor is vim, though I started with emacs in COMP 211 at Wesleyan and have recently been playing with sublime text 2.  I mainly work in python and Standard ML/NJ for academic work, though I have experience with Javascript, Ruby, and a mixed bag of all sorts of other awesome stuff.</p>
