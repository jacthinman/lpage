      <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in the suburbs of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I recently graduated from <a href="http://www.wesleyan.edu" target="_blank">Wesleyan University</a> ('15) with a Bachelor of Arts in computer science and <a href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/sisp/" target="_blank">science in society</a>.  In 2013 I studied computer science and entrepreneurship in Budapest, Hungary at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ait-budapest.com">Aquincum Institute of Technology</a>. I am currently a part of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>'s Maps team.</p>

        <p>Though I find great satisfaction in creating software that makes everyday tasks simpler and more enjoyable, I also care greatly about how that software functions in a user's (read: non-developer's) hands.  From this, two things follow: First, I am fixated on the design of the things I create – not just how it looks, but how it is used.  Second, and this is where the science in society major originates, I am also very intersted in how new technologies change the way people live and act – socially, intellectually, emotionally, etc.  The technology that we use on a daily basis has changed at a nearly unfathomable scale in the past few decades, and I am interested in studying how that impacts us individually as well as from a broader societal perspective.</p>

      <h2 id="housing-hide">housing In the Bay (want to be roommates?)</h2>
      <div id="housing-text">

        <p>Wesleyan requires students to live on campus, so while I do not have former landlords, I am happy to provide former roommate references.  I lived in San Francisco in 2014 and Palo Alto in 2013 for summer internships, so I know the Bay well.</p>

        <p>I try to keep a consistent schedule during the week, leaving around 7:00 and returning at 19:00 or so.  I keep my things organized, and generally work to keep my living spaces clean.  I cook somewhat regularly (2-3 times a week), but always clean up immediately afterward.  I usually listen to music when working, but will switch to headphones if I want things loud.  On weekends, I generally sleep in and enjoy going out with friends at night.</p>

        <p>My ideal roommate/s is/are conversational and respectful of shared spaces.  I am queer, and would prefer to live with another queer-identifying person if possible.  Beyond that, I am flexible and would just like to have another person around!</p>

        <p>If this sounds good to you, please shoot me an <a href="mailto:eislo@wesleyan.edu?Subject=From%20eriki.net" target="_top">email</a>!  I would love to chat :)</p>

      <h4><i>Nerds like us are allowed to be unironically enthusiastic about stuff. [. . .] Nerds are allowed to <i>love</i> stuff, like jump-up-and-down-in-the-chair-can’t-control-yourself love it. When people call people nerds, mostly what they’re saying is ‘you like stuff.’ Which is just not a good insult at all, like, ‘you are too enthusiastic about the miracle of human consciousness.’</i><br /><a id="jgquote">– John Greene</a></h4>

        <p>I have worked primarily with Java, Python, and Standard ML/NJ, though I have experience with Javascript, Ruby, and am currenlty learning C++ and Objective-C.</p>
