    <h1 class="name">Hi, I'm Erik.</h1>

    <div class="article">
      <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in the suburbs of Milwaukee, I am now studying computer science and science in society at Wesleyan University.  For the fall semester of 2013, I will be studying abroad in Budapest Hungary at <a href="http://www.ait-budapest.com">AIT</a>.  Here, I am taking courses in computer science as well as entrepreneurship.</p>  

        <p>Though I find great satisfaction in creating software that makes everyday tasks simpler and more enjoyable, I also care greatly about how that software functions in a user's (read: non-developer's) hands.  From this, I have chosen my second major, science in society with a concentration in sociology.  Through this I am studying the impacts technology has and does have on societies around the world.</p>

        <br />

      <h2>Technical Things</h2>
      <h4><i>I love geeks.  It means you have passion for something.  If you don't... you're probably boring.</i></h4>
        <p>I have worked with emacs, vim, and now Sublime Text 2.  Though I am most familiar with vim, I want to expand my experience with other editors so this website is being built in Sublime Text.  Life goal: Build an awesome .vimrc or .emacs or the equivalent for whatever editor I end up using at the end of this year.</p>

        <p>I am using chrome for most testing of this site, though firefox, safari and <acronym title="You really SHOULD NOT use it though">Internet Explorer</acronym> when I have a chance.  If there are issues with the website, please <a class="link" href="/contact" title="I know putting this in the depths of the about section probably won't work, but I'll say site organization is yet another future project.">let me know</a>!</p>

        <p>Unix is awesome and people who like to talk about why Unix is awesome are also awesome.</p>

        <p>I think that'll be it for now.</p>
